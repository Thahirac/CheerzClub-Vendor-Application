The Buyer and/or guest is responsible for enforcing the relevant legislation upon delivery.\n3.\tAlcohol can be a risk to human health, any statements of Cheerzclub and/or the relevant restaurant and its representatives, such as \"Enjoy in moderation\" and \"NIX18\" should therefore never be interpreted as medical advice. If in doubt, consult a doctor or dietitian.\n4.\tAlcohol should only be used orally. The Buyer and/or the guest must refrain from so-called \"slimming\" (the anal or vaginal insertion of alcohol).\n\nArticle 13 - Suspension and Dissolution\n\n1.\tCheerzclub is authorised to suspend the fulfilment of the obligations or to dissolve the Agreement if the Buyer does not or not fully comply with the (payment) obligations under the Agreement.\n2.\tIn addition, Cheerzclub is authorised to terminate the Agreement existing between it and the Buyer, insofar as it has not yet been executed, without judicial intervention, if the Buyer does not properly comply or comply on time with its obligations arising from any Agreement concluded with Cheerzclub.\n3.\tCheerzclub shall furthermore be authorised to dissolve the agreement (have the agreement dissolved) if circumstances arise of such a nature that fulfilment of the obligations becomes impossible or can no longer be demanded in accordance with the requirements of reasonableness and fairness, or if other circumstances arise of such a nature that the unaltered maintenance of the Agreement can no longer be demanded in all reasonableness\n4.\tIf the Agreement is dissolved, the claims of Cheerzclub on the Buyer are immediately due and payable. When Cheerzclub suspends the fulfilment of the obligations, it retains its rights under the law and the Agreement.\n5.\tCheerzclub always reserves the right to claim compensation.\n\nArticle 14 – Limitation of Liability\n\n1.\tIf the execution of the Agreement by Cheerzclub leads to liability of Cheerzclub towards the Buyer or third parties, that liability is limited to the costs charged by Cheerzclub in connection with the Agreement, unless the damage is caused by intent or gross negligence.

If this period continues for longer than two months, either of the parties are entitled to dissolve the Agreement without any obligation to pay compensation for any loss suffered by the other party.\n5.\tTo the extent that the Cheerzclub has partially fulfilled or will be able to partially fulfil the obligations under the agreement when the force majeure begins, and the fulfilled or to be fulfilled part has independent value, Cheerzclub is entitled to separately invoice the fulfilled or to be fulfilled part.
